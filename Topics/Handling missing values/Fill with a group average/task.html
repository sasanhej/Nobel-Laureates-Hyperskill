<p>You're provided with a dataset which has the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">location</code> is either Hypercity or Skilltown, where a flat is located;</li>
<li><code class="java">price</code> is price;</li>
<li><code class="java">height</code> is the height of a building (m).</li>
</ul>
<p>Hypercity is a big city, so there are many tall buildings. Skilltown, in turn, is a small town in the countryside so most buildings are private houses with no more than 3-4 floors.</p>
<p>Load the given dataset into your IDE using <code class="java">pandas</code>; replace <code class="java">NaN</code>s in the <code class="java">height</code> column with the average height of buildings in the city/town, where a given flat is located. Round values to the first decimal place<em>.</em> Then calculate the sum of the height column and insert it into the answer section.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">location,price,height<br>Hypercity,151,37.4<br>Hypercity,192,15.9<br>Skilltown,114,NaN<br>Hypercity,171,17.8<br>Hypercity,160,29.4<br>Hypercity,120,NaN<br>Hypercity,182,38.1<br>Hypercity,186,NaN<br>Skilltown,174,9.0<br>Hypercity,174,20.9<br>Hypercity,187,49.7<br>Hypercity,199,32.7<br>Hypercity,123,35.7<br>Hypercity,102,20.8<br>Hypercity,121,NaN<br>Hypercity,152,36.1<br>Skilltown,101,21.3<br>Hypercity,187,23.5<br>Skilltown,129,NaN<br>Skilltown,137,6.7<br>Hypercity,101,38.8<br>Hypercity,163,29.0<br>Skilltown,159,NaN<br>Skilltown,120,NaN<br>Skilltown,132,13.0<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">617.0</code></pre><br><br>
