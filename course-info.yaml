summary: "<p>Medical researchers have found that if the medicine label contains only\
  \ text, a person learns only 70% of the information on it. But if a piece of instructions\
  \ has pictures, a person will learn 95%. In this project, you will explore data\
  \ about Nobel laureates and apply Python tools for visualization. Start with data\
  \ cleaning that includes handling missing values and dealing with duplicates. Then\
  \ proceed to the data visualization. By the end of the project, you will get the\
  \ graphs showing the main insights for the dataset.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a\
